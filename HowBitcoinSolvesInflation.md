### What is inflation and how its caused?

Have you ever asked your parents or grandparents about what prices used to be when they were kids?

if so, they probably told anout how milk or any goods used to be much cheaper?

This is true. over a long period of time, most of the things tend to get more and more expensive. this is something due to inflatiopn.

- over a period of time money loses its value. in other words, a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.

- when it is out of control, it is called as hyperinflation.

### what will be the outcome of inflation?

- Drop in purchasing power. perople will have more money and goods supply will be less, there will be an inbalance between supply and demand. so the prices of the goods also increses.

### Does this mean inflation is bad?

- No, it doesn't work like that. a small amout of inflation is required to maintain the balance in the economy.

### What Causes Inflation?

#### Excess Printing of money. 
- This is why i call it as fiat is a disaster. since it is centralized and not backed by any commodity , gov't will try to print more money. 

- when there is more currency in circulation, currency loses its value. we have already seen this in countries like Velensulia, Zimbamwe which faces hyperinflation.

#### Increment in Salary.

- If the salary keeps on increasing and prices of goods remain same, there will be an inbalance right?

#### Producers spending more to produce.

- If Producer has to pay more wagesm they have to adjust the price and set high margins to gain profits.


### If possible mining.

- Mining is something where new btc are circulated around. miners verify the transaction and adds this record to block. they will be rewared with new bitcoins.


The opposite of this is called deflation- company tends to produce less goods, which leads to layoff, salary reduction etc. when there are too many goods avaliable and there is no enough money circulationg to purchase those goods.

at the end it boils down to problems with centralizationa and excess money in circulation.
