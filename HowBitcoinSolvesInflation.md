### Raw and unedited draft- fix typos and gramatical errors later.

To understand Bitcoin, one need to know how current monetary system works and what are the problems it has and what was the motive behind cryptos. - refer last 2 videos. 

### What is inflation and how its caused?

Have you ever asked your parents or grandparents about what prices used to be when they were kids?

if so, they probably told anout how milk or any goods used to be much cheaper?

This is true. over a long period of time, most of the things tend to get more and more expensive. this is something due to inflatiopn.

- over a period of time money loses its value. in other words, a general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.

- when it is out of control, it is called as hyperinflation.

### what will be the outcome of inflation?

- Drop in purchasing power. perople will have more money and goods supply will be less, there will be an inbalance between supply and demand. so the prices of the goods also increses.

### Does this mean inflation is bad?

- No, it doesn't work like that. a small amout of inflation is required to maintain the balance in the economy.

### What Causes Inflation?

#### Excess Printing of money. 
- This is why i call it as fiat is a disaster. since it is centralized and not backed by any commodity , gov't will try to print more money. 

- when there is more currency in circulation, currency loses its value. we have already seen this in countries like Velensulia, Zimbamwe which faces hyperinflation.

#### Increment in Salary.

- If the salary keeps on increasing and prices of goods remain same, there will be an inbalance right?

#### Producers spending more to produce.

- If Producer has to pay more wagesm they have to adjust the price and set high margins to gain profits.


The opposite of this is called deflation- company tends to produce less goods, which leads to layoff, salary reduction etc. when there are too many goods avaliable and there is no enough money circulationg to purchase those goods.

at the end it boils down to problems with centralizationa and excess money in circulation.



### How bitcoin solves inflation?

Bitcoin is designed to resist inflation. i.e supply is limited and known. creation of new BTC is also defined in the protocol and it is in a predictabl way.

- There will be only 21 million BTC can ever exists and every 4 years the amount of BTC mined is reduced by half.

- Mining is something where new btc are created and circulated around. miners verify the transaction and adds this record to block. they will be rewared with new bitcoins. there are lot of things going behind the scenes. i have explained this in simpler terms. this can be another seperate topic.


- BTC can't be manuplated by government like printing more money or adjusting intrest rates to achieve policy goals.

- Every 10minutes, miners process a new block and as of 2020 , 6.25BTC will be rewadered to them. this is the only possible way to create new Bitcoins.



- Bitcoin maintains its own internal clock. every 4years, the amount of BTC awarded to miners will be reduced to half untill all 21mil is mined.this process is called Halving. the last bitcoin will be mined in the year 2140. this mechanism helpes btc as inflation resistance.

Bitcoin is divisible upto 18decimal points!!


### What will happen aftyer mining all 21 mil BTC?

Network still survives. it will remain the same. miners will be earning through transaction fees. it won't be used as a currecy. it can be a good store value like Gold.




#### Does this mean, crypto currency doesn't experience inflation? 

- Technically, Bitcoin do experience inflation. but , due to halving, the amount of new BTC is automaticaly reduced by 50% evry 4years. by halving BTC's inflation rate will also decrese.

#### Conclusion - 


- Bitcoin Protocol is designed in such a way that even if it is a digital money, it cannot be created endlessly. in case of Fiat, there will be unlimited supply and it declines its value.

- Note- not all cryptocurrency are designed like bitcoin. there are some stable coins that is pegged to USD or any other currencies. if you invest in those, your investments will be impacted by inflation.



### upcoming talks.

- Should your store your crytos in your wallet or leave it in exchanges like coinswitch, wazirx.
- Different types of Crypto wallets.
