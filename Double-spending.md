### Double spending problem

- “If someone gives you a block of gold, you know that it hasn’t been spent already because you have it, and gold can only be in one place” 

Double-spending is the risk that a cryptocurrency can be used twice or more. Transaction information within a blockchain can be altered if specific conditions are met. The conditions allow modified blocks to enter the blockchain; if this happens, the person that initiated the alteration can reclaim spent coins.

- Double-spending occurs when someone alters a blockchain network and inserts a special one that allows them to reacquire a cryptocurrency.
- Double-spending can happen, but it is more likely that a cryptocurrency is stolen from a wallet that wasn't adequately protected and secured.
- Many variations of attacks could be used for double-spending—51% is one of the most commonly cited attacks, while the unconfirmed transaction attack is most commonly seen.


- Double-spending is the possibility that a digital currency (for the puprose of this video Bitcoin) can be spent twice. This could be a problem for digital currencies because digital information can be reproduced relatively easily by savvy individuals who understand the blockchain network and the computing power necessary to manipulate it.
- A main concern of any cryptocurrency developer is the issue of double-spending. This refers to the incidence of an individual spending a balance of that cryptocurrency more than once, effectively creating a disparity between the spending record and the amount of that cryptocurrency available, as well as the way that it is distributed.
- Bitcoin manages the double spending problem by implementing a confirmation mechanism and maintaining a universal ledger (called “blockchain”), similar to the traditional cash monetary system.
- Bitcoin’s blockchain maintains a chronologically-ordered, time-stamped transaction ledger from the very start of its operation in 2009.

- Every 10 mins, a block (i.e. a group of transactions) is added to the ledger. And all the nodes on the Bitcoin network keep a copy of this global ledger (the blockchain).
