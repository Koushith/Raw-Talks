## WIP- draft copy

Hello guys, welcome back to my channel, this is one of the series of experiments which i'm trying this year. every thursdays i will talk about some random topics which intrests me. again- i'm not a proffectional. all thoughts are reflection of my learnings. i'm just trying to solidify my knowledge by sharaing it with you all. i'm not aiming to gain followers or increase my view count. this channel is all about documenting my journey. i might make mistakases, feel free to correct me.

Today we will talk about what was the need for crypto currencies, how bitcoin came into existance and so on. my twitter feed is filled with web3, NFT, cryptos. forget about NFT, lets talk about cryptos and why this was created. to understand this you need to know a little bit of History. How money works? what was the problem?

### History of Money

### Barter system

in ancient times, we used to follow barter system to trade. i.e exchange of goods and services between two people. lets not get into depth here. but you need to understand this is not sustainable. it had major problemes like

- Measure of value.
- Difficult in storing.
- impossible to divide.
- Demands.

To solve this gold coins was introduced.

### Gold Standard

From gold coins to paper notes backed by the gold standard, only recently has money moved to a fiat system that is not backed by a physical commodity.

### Problem with central authority

### Idea that lead to decentralization

### Concepts of Blockchain and Crypto

- Cryptocurrency is not a blanket currency-> not all cryptos are currencies.

21 million total crculation. the value of coin you have is confirmed. regular currencies cannot be a storee of value. value is not conserved gere.

### Takeaways

- bitcoin is the extension of economic value.
- This will not kill the regular Fiat currency
