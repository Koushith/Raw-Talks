### BYOB- 


### Problems with Fiat and centralization

### What does BYOB means?

The whole puropse of the crypto is to "Be Your own Bank!!" - will come to this later.

### Blockchain- crypto usecase

 if you think about the usecases of Blockchain- crypto- if i try to list out i would come up with 5-6. it's still in the early stage.
 - Currency Aspects- P2P'
 - Defi

 - SmartContracts
 - DAO's

### Early days of internet and its usecases.
similarly, if you ask the usecase of Innternet in early 1997-2000, people used to critisise this as www bubble. what could be the possible usecases?
- Blogs- publishing

more over its centralized. controlled by central authority.

what was the problem?  we need to trust them and agree on thier set of rules. i'm not saying that we shouldn't trust them. we cant do anything about that. this is the default system today.

what if there is another possible way?

### Idea of Crypto is Decentralization.



### Banks- inflation, controlling funds

### BTC- Store of value.

### Problems with gold.

### Key takeaways

- if bank helped peopole in making money, the rich gets richer. what i mean by that is, when you deposit yourmoney, they have rights to do whatever they want. they can invest that somewhere and make profits. in return what do we get? - we get on average 3% annual intrest. may be. not sure how much it is.

### Why? why is this?

- a bunch of white guys made this system, why would they even change this, when its made them rich?

- why should i take advice from banks?- not to invest in BTC?

- ofcorce govt protects its people and maintain peace. but, strong central govenment protects people, but only their citizens.

- Crypto has no borders,it can be a true global currency and censorship resistance for those who needs urjently.

### What can be the future? TBH- IDK

- no currency starts with universal adoption, it takes time for the places to make it happen.

- Crypto is the balance to the centralized model.
