### Mint based currency model-

- Government backed currencies use familar mint based model in which a central authority known as Mint. 
- Mint verifies that transactions cannot be doublespent. currency is returned to the mint and is periodically destroyed in order to create new currency. 


- Along with Production- mint is also responsible for distribution of currency and protection of mint's assets.

The Bitcoin whitepaper proposed eliminating that mint based central authority by publishing each and every transaction on digital-only-network. to accomplish this without a trusted party, transaction must be publically annunced and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they have received.
the payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first recieved.



The India Government Mint operates four mints in the country for the production of coins:

Mumbai, Maharashtra
Kolkata, West Bengal
Hyderabad, Telangana
Noida, Uttar Pradesh
