### what makes crypto tokens valueable?

- Have you ever wondered wht some tokens are worth more than others?
- where does that worth come from?
- what are the fifferences between coins that seems to do the same thing?

Token economics is a way of looking at how token creates and sustains its value.

when you are intrested in particular project or a token, whitepaper is the best place to start. if a project doesn't have a white paper or any kind of technical information avaliable, that's the red flag.

### Let's get started.

At the very begening where  did the coin come from?

let's take Bitcoin- bitcoins are generated ebery time a block is mined and and there is a hard cap on the total number of BTC that will ever exist. this makes the coin more valueable than the coin generated from the thin air.

#### Creating value given to equally useful coins- the one with 21mil exesistance will be worth more than 1Bil in existance.
