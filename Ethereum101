### what is Ethereum?

it is worlds first programmable blockchain. it is heavily inspired by bitcoin. bitcoin had lot of drawbacks. both lets you yo use digital money without payment providers or banks, but etherium is programmable, sp that you can use

it sa foundation for our digtal future,

etehrium is open access to digital money and data-friendly serivces for everyone no matter your background or location.


Thnink like - features

- Bank for everyone 

not everyone has the axxess to finicial services, but here if you want to access the services that banking provides all ou need is a etheium wallet, ether and internet. today, billions of people cant open bank accounts, payments were blocked. etheriums decentralized finance system never sleeps or discriminates. with just an internet connection, you can send, recoeve, borrow and earn intres, even stream funds anywhere in the world.

- Private internet 

you dont need to provide your personal details to use an etherium dapp. it is building an economy based on valu.

- Peer to peer network

 Etehrium allow you to move money, or make contracts directly with simeone. you dont have to go through intermediaters.
 
 - Censorship ressitant.

no company or government has the control over etherium. this decentraization makes it nearly impossible for anyone to stop you from rece=ieving money or using dapps.

Etherium is moren than payments. its a marketplace of fininciaal services, games and apps that cant steal your data or censor you.

note- etheroum ansd eth is differenct . etherium is the blockchain and ther is the currency that powers the blockchain.

to use any of the etherium services you need eth. thats how the price demand of ether goes on. 

best way to get started is to get a wallet and few ethg, try out few dapps. in the upcoming streams, we will try out few dapps.

lets talk about few usecases -

- Defi

 a open finincial system that gives you more control over your money and unlocks new possiblitties. if you have done any cross borer transaction, you will know the pain. here you can send recieve ,borroew or lend- you can do pretty much anything that modern banks can do,

- Assets.


etherium isnt just for digital money. anything you can own can be represented, traded amd put into use as non fungible tokens, you can tokenize your art and get royalties automaticallt everytime it is re-sold, or use that and take loan. there are endless possiblities.

nfts are the way to represet uniquiqe items as etherium assets.

- DAO's

A new way to collabrate and setup online communities with shared goald and pooled funds. token comes into play here. more about dao's in upcoming streams,
think about the, as a native business that is colletively owned and managfed by its menbers. they have built in treasures that no one has the authority to access without the approval of group. decisions are governed by proposals and voting. there is no ceo who can authorize or man=uplate.

## DAO examples

To help this make more sense, here's a few examples of how you could use a DAO:

- A charity –

you can accept membership and donations from anyone in the world and the group can decide how they want to spend donations.

- Ventures and grants – 

you could create a venture fund that pools investment capital and votes on ventures to back. Repaid money could later be redistributed amongst DAO-members.


how incentivzn works? 

when you send eth or etherium powered application, you will have to pay small fee in eth to use the etherium network. thi sfee is an incentive for a miner to process and verify what you are trying to do.

minorors are like record keepers. they check and prove that no one is cheaing. they are rewared with small amounts of newly issied eth.
